# WirelessRemoteControl
Just a test sketch for a (presently indoor) quadcopter. I have a few Bluetooth modules lying around so I'm just going to use those as it's absurdly simple.  Their range is only 10m though. Later I'd like to add a cPLD and a standalone Atmel 328p on a PCB with maybe a longer range homemade wireless system. You know, the good stuff.
